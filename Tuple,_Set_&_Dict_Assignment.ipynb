        "Q1. What are the characteristics of the tuples? Is tuple immutable?\n",
        "Ans.A tuple is a collection of ordered, immutable elements, often of different data types, separated by commas. The elements of a tuple are called items. Some of the key characteristics of tuples include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable: Once created, the elements of a tuple cannot be changed. This makes tuples suitable for representing values that should not change over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ordered: The items in a tuple are ordered, meaning that each item has a specific position within the tuple. This allows you to access and manipulate individual items in a tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "Heterogeneous: The items in a tuple can be of different data types, such as integers, strings, and other data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Accessible by index: You can access the items in a tuple by their index, which is an integer that represents their position within the tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "Uses parentheses: Tuples are typically represented using parentheses, ( and ), to separate the items.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the immutability and ordered nature of tuples make them useful for representing values that should not change and need to be stored in a specific order, such as dates, coordinates, and so on.\n",

        "Ans.Tuples have only two built-in methods as compared to lists because tuples are designed to be simple, lightweight, and efficient. The primary purpose of tuples is to store values that should not change, and the count and index methods provide just enough functionality to search for and retrieve values from tuples. Lists, on the other hand, are more complex and versatile data structures that support a wider range of operations, including adding and removing elements, sorting, and more.\n"

The order of the items in a dictionary may change if the dictionary is modified, and it is not guaranteed to be consistent from one program execution to the next. This makes dictionaries suitable for tasks where the order of the items is not important, and you need to access the values quickly based on their keys."
